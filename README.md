# [LSTM based Model for Real-time Stock Market Prediction on Unexpected Incidents](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354256574_LSTM_based_Model_for_Real-time_Stock_Market_Prediction_on_Unexpected_Incidents)

Events like the 9/11 terrorist attacks can be destructive for global and local markets. Investors need to assess the sudden events'
effects on a minute-by-minute basis to evaluate market reactions precisely for a better investment strategy. Despite the web
crawler's availability, it is challenging to mine biased data; however, we build an artificial intelligence (AI) based model to
make a better investment strategy that uses unexpected incidents like terrorist attacks and other natural disasters like floods and
earthquakes. For this, we used Pakistan's real-time terrorist attacks, floods, and earthquakes data and Pakistan stock market
KSE100 index data to feed the model which predicts swift market changes. We study unexpected real-world incident data and
stock market data from 2001 to 2020.
